HDB flats are an important element of the city-state's housing environment, playing an important role in providing cheap accommodation to its residents. There are many possible factors that affect the resale price and hence this notebook aims to study and identify these following factors. This project also aims to analyse different machine learning algorithms to train on the identified features to predict the resale price.
